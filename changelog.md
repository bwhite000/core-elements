CoreIcon Changelog
==================

v0.0.9 (5.28.2015)
-----------------
* Updated the package link to the original CoreElements > CoreIcon project SVGs
  in the "lib/core_icon.html" page.
* Rescraped and updated the core icon SVGs to match v0.5 from the main Google
  project; this includes many new icons and cleaned-up older ones.
* Removed all of the old CoreIcon SVGs from lib/core_icon.html page so that it would
  only be a page with the custom element template and have the old way of SVGs being
  inline to being external in the lib/core-icons folder; more efficient and removed
  old/original way support in favor of new.
* Updated the ReadMe examples to use the new package name.

v0.0.8 (5.18.2015)
------------------
* Updated the paths in the TemplateElement querySelector() path to use the
  new core_icon package name.

v0.0.7 (5.18.2015)
--------------------
* Removed the ShadowRoot, added a global CSS Stylesheet, and now have the SVG
  directly as a child element for <core-icon>.
* Updated the homepage in the Pubspec to point to my Google+ account page.
* Changed the package name to core_icon from core_elements in the Pubspec and
  the repo name on GitHub.

v0.0.6 (3.11.2015)
------------------
* First GitHub commit of my work so far!
* Work on the CoreIcon element.
